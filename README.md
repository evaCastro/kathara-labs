Kathará(https://www.kathara.org/) is an open source container-based network emulation system for showing interactive demos/lessons, testing production networks in a sandbox environment, or developing new network protocols. 

Learn network protocols by studying traffic capture files:
   - [DNS:](https://github.com/evaCastro/kathara-labs/blob/main/dns) without DNSSEC validation
   - [HTTP:](https://github.com/evaCastro/kathara-labs/blob/main/http) HTTP server and HTTP proxy.
   - [HTTPS:](https://github.com/evaCastro/kathara-labs/blob/main/https) TLS1.3 Handshake
